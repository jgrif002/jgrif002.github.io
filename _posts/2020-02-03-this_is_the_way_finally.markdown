Why did I decide to study Software Engineering? The answer to that question took its time, that is for sure!

I have been thinking about studying Software Engineering off and on for about three and a half years(YIKES.) Every time I would get on the wagon and try to put my best foot forward there was always a convenient excuse not to dive in. It was starting to become comically sad and personally defeating. Was Software Development actually for me? It wasn’t until December 2019 when I finally wouldn’t let myself walk away. Committing to a full time job and school was a tough first hurdle. Who doesn’t love time for family, netflix and nothing after a long day of work?

I have worked in trucking for the last nine years in a multitude of entry level and senior level roles. I’ve worked on different teams such as account management, sales, operations and most recently pricing. I wanted my next move, as a professional, to benefit from that exposure and experience. I asked myself “you're in the business of trucks and trailers man, what could be next?” Everyday I would read a new article about how tech was getting involved in trucking and it was time to finally be a part of that.

We’re seeing a huge tech push from traditional powerhouses and startups #disrupting the industry. They are bringing tech to trucking when it needed it most! The system was old and it needed to be revamped. I want to be a part of that change.

I realized I truly love trucking and the company I work for. I want to be able to help create the foundation that this company can build on and continually improve moving into the future. I want to be continually challenged. I want to be required to keep developing and learning as a professional. This is my next step. This is where I belong and I know that now. Everything I’ve done has led me to this. I can’t wait to explore the challenges that I know are ahead of me. It’s not going to be easy but Kobe said it best “The dream is not the destination, it is the journey. The journey is the dream.”
